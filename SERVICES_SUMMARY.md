# Aurora Microservices Summary

## Recommended Service Architecture

Based on Aurora's features and Domain-Driven Design principles, here are the recommended microservices:

## Core Services (Priority 1)

### 1. ✅ Identity Service
**Port:** 5000  
**Purpose:** Authentication, authorization, user management  
**Why:** Foundation for all other services - handles user identity and security

### 2. ✅ API Gateway (BFF)
**Port:** 4000  
**Purpose:** Single entry point, routing, rate limiting  
**Why:** Simplifies frontend integration, centralized cross-cutting concerns

### 3. ✅ Thoughts Service
**Port:** 4001  
**Purpose:** Quick thought capture and retrieval  
**Why:** Core feature - maps directly to "Thoughts" bounded context

### 4. ✅ Journals Service
**Port:** 4002  
**Purpose:** Journal and entry management  
**Why:** Core feature - maps to "Journals" bounded context

### 5. ✅ Planning Service
**Port:** 4003  
**Purpose:** Tasks and events management  
**Why:** Core feature - maps to "Planning" bounded context

## Enhanced Services (Priority 2)

### 6. ✅ Search Service
**Port:** 4004  
**Purpose:** Cross-domain unified search  
**Why:** Critical for user experience - search across all content types

### 7. ✅ Notifications Service
**Port:** 4005  
**Purpose:** Reminders, alerts, notifications  
**Why:** Engagement - task reminders, event notifications

## Analytics Services (Priority 3)

### 8. ✅ Analytics Service
**Port:** 4006  
**Purpose:** Productivity metrics, insights, statistics  
**Why:** Value-add - helps users understand their productivity patterns

## Infrastructure Services

### Supporting Infrastructure
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary data store for most services
- **Redis** - Caching, sessions, rate limiting
- **RabbitMQ/Kafka** - Event-driven communication
- **Elasticsearch/Meilisearch** - Search indexing (Search Service)
- **TimescaleDB/InfluxDB** - Time-series data (Analytics)

## Service Ports Reference

| Service | Port | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| Frontend | 3000 | Next.js web app |
| API Gateway | 4000 | Request routing, auth middleware |
| Thoughts | 4001 | Thoughts CRUD |
| Journals | 4002 | Journals & entries CRUD |
| Planning | 4003 | Tasks & events CRUD |
| Search | 4004 | Unified search |
| Notifications | 4005 | Alerts & reminders |
| Analytics | 4006 | Metrics & insights |
| Identity | 5000 | Auth & user management |

---

## Why This Architecture?

### Bounded Contexts
Each service represents a clear bounded context:
- **Identity** = User & Access Management
- **Thoughts** = Quick Capture
- **Journals** = Structured Writing
- **Planning** = Time Management
- **Search** = Discovery
- **Notifications** = Engagement
- **Analytics** = Insights

### Benefits
1. **Scalability**: Scale high-traffic services (Search, Analytics) independently
2. **Team Autonomy**: Different teams can own different services
3. **Resilience**: Failure in one service doesn't crash the system
4. **Technology Flexibility**: Use best tools per service
5. **Clear Responsibilities**: Each service has one reason to change

### Alternative: Start with Modular Monolith?

If your team is small (<5 developers), consider starting with a **modular monolith**:

```
services/
└── monolith/
    ├── modules/
    │   ├── identity/
    │   ├── thoughts/
    │   ├── journals/
    │   ├── planning/
    │   └── search/
    └── shared/
```

**Pros:**
- Simpler deployment
- Easier local development
- Faster initial development
- Can split into microservices later

**Cons:**
- Harder to scale specific features
- More discipline needed for module boundaries
- Longer build/test times

## Technology Stack Recommendations

### Backend Services
- **Language:** Node.js with TypeScript (or Go for high-performance services)
- **Framework:** Express (simple) or NestJS (enterprise-grade)
- **Validation:** Joi or Zod
- **Testing:** Jest + Supertest

### Databases
- **PostgreSQL 15+:** Primary database for most services
- **Redis 7+:** Caching, sessions, job queues
- **Elasticsearch 8+ or Meilisearch:** Search service
- **TimescaleDB:** Analytics time-series data

### Message Queue
- **RabbitMQ:** Good for smaller scale, easier to operate
- **Apache Kafka:** Better for large scale, more complex

### Observability
- **Logging:** Winston + ELK Stack or Loki
- **Metrics:** Prometheus + Grafana
- **Tracing:** Jaeger or Zipkin
- **Error Tracking:** Sentry

### Deployment
- **Development:** Docker Compose
- **Production:** Kubernetes with Helm charts
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
- **Cloud:** AWS, GCP, or Azure

---

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous (REST)
Use for:
- User-initiated actions requiring immediate response
- Frontend → API Gateway → Services
- Authentication checks

### Asynchronous (Events)
Use for:
- Search index updates
- Analytics data collection
- Notifications
- Cross-service data synchronization

### Example Event Flow
```
User creates task
  ↓
Planning Service publishes TaskCreated event
  ↓
├→ Search Service (indexes task)
├→ Analytics Service (updates metrics)
└→ Notifications Service (schedules reminder)
```

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication:** JWT tokens with short expiry (15min)
2. **Authorization:** RBAC in Identity Service
3. **API Gateway:** Validates tokens before routing
4. **Service-to-Service:** Internal JWT or mTLS
5. **Data:** Encryption at rest and in transit
6. **Rate Limiting:** Per-user, per-service
7. **Input Validation:** Every service validates inputs
8. **SQL Injection:** Use parameterized queries
9. **CORS:** Configured properly in API Gateway
10. **Secrets:** Managed via Kubernetes secrets or Vault

---

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics to Track

**Business Metrics:**
- New user registrations
- Daily active users
- Thoughts created per day
- Journal entries per day
- Tasks completed per day

**Technical Metrics:**
- Request rate per service
- Response time (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rate per endpoint
- Database connection pool usage
- Cache hit rate
- Message queue lag

### Alerts
- Error rate > 5%
- Response time p95 > 500ms
- Database connections > 80%
- Message queue lag > 1000 messages
- Service health check failures

## Cost Optimization

### Cloud Costs (AWS Example)

**Small Scale (1,000 users):**
- Compute (ECS/EKS): ~$200/month
- Database (RDS): ~$100/month
- Cache (ElastiCache): ~$50/month
- Load Balancer: ~$25/month
- **Total:** ~$375/month

**Medium Scale (10,000 users):**
- Compute: ~$800/month
- Database: ~$400/month
- Cache: ~$150/month
- CDN (CloudFront): ~$50/month
- **Total:** ~$1,400/month

### Optimization Strategies
1. Use spot instances for non-critical services
2. Implement aggressive caching
3. Use CDN for static assets
4. Database connection pooling
5. Horizontal pod autoscaling in K8s
6. Archive old data to cheaper storage

## Questions to Consider

1. **Team Size:** How many developers? (Affects monolith vs microservices decision)
2. **Scale:** Expected user count? (Affects infrastructure choices)
3. **Budget:** Infrastructure budget? (Affects cloud provider and architecture)
4. **Timeline:** Launch deadline? (Affects MVP scope)
5. **Expertise:** Team's expertise with microservices? (Learning curve consideration)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review ARCHITECTURE.md** for detailed service specifications
2. **Review each service's README** in `services/` directory
3. **Decide:** Microservices or Modular Monolith to start?
4. **Set up:** Infrastructure (databases, message queue)
5. **Implement:** Phase 1 services (Identity → Gateway → Core features)
