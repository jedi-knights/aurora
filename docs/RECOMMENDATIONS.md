# Architecture Recommendations

## TL;DR

**Start with a simple monolith** (SIMPLE_ARCHITECTURE.md). The full microservices architecture (ARCHITECTURE.md) is over-engineered for Aurora's current scope.

## Decision Matrix

### Choose Monolith If:
- ✅ Team size < 10 developers
- ✅ Users < 100k
- ✅ Need to ship fast
- ✅ Budget conscious
- ✅ Simple deployment preferred
- ✅ Don't have DevOps expertise

**→ See [SIMPLE_ARCHITECTURE.md](./SIMPLE_ARCHITECTURE.md)**

### Choose Microservices If:
- ❌ Team size > 10 developers
- ❌ Users > 100k+
- ❌ Need independent scaling
- ❌ Multiple teams need autonomy
- ❌ Have specific bottlenecks
- ❌ Have strong DevOps capabilities

**→ See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)**

## Honest Assessment for Aurora

Aurora is a **personal productivity app** with:
- Quick thoughts
- Journals with entries
- Tasks and events

This is **NOT**:
- Netflix (needs massive scale)
- Uber (needs real-time coordination)
- Amazon (needs complex workflows)
- Slack (needs real-time messaging)

### Reality Check

The full 8-microservices architecture would be:
- 🚫 **Overkill** for current needs
- 🚫 **14x more expensive** to run
- 🚫 **Slower to develop**
- 🚫 **Harder to maintain**
- 🚫 **Complex to debug**
- 🚫 **Requires DevOps expertise**

## Recommended Path

### Phase 1: Monolith (Months 1-4)
Build a well-structured modular monolith:
```
backend/
├── modules/
│   ├── auth/
│   ├── thoughts/
│   ├── journals/
│   └── planning/
```

**When done:** You have a working app with all features!

### Phase 2: Optimize (Months 5-6)
Add enhancements within the monolith:
- Full-text search (PostgreSQL)
- Background jobs (Bull + Redis)
- Email notifications (SendGrid)
- Caching (Redis)

**When done:** Polished app handling 10k+ users!

### Phase 3: Scale (Only if needed)
If you hit 100k users or real bottlenecks:
- Extract Search Service (if needed)
- Extract Notifications Service (if needed)
- Keep the rest together

**When done:** Scaled architecture without over-engineering!

## Cost Comparison

### Option 1: Monolith
- **Development time:** 3-4 months
- **Monthly cost:** ~$35 (handles 10k users)
- **Team size:** 2-3 developers
- **DevOps:** Minimal (Docker Compose)

### Option 2: Full Microservices
- **Development time:** 6+ months
- **Monthly cost:** ~$485 (same 10k users)
- **Team size:** 5+ developers
- **DevOps:** Full-time role needed

**14x cost difference for the same functionality!**

## What About the Microservices Docs?

The full architecture documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md, service READMEs) is valuable as:

1. **Future reference** - When you actually need to scale
2. **Learning resource** - Understanding patterns
3. **Blueprint** - Clear bounded contexts to maintain in monolith
4. **Migration guide** - How to split when needed

Keep them! Just don't implement them yet.

## Migration Strategy

Your monolith should follow the same **bounded contexts**:

```javascript
// Monolith structure mirrors microservices
modules/
├── auth/        // → Future: Identity Service
├── thoughts/    // → Future: Thoughts Service
├── journals/    // → Future: Journals Service
└── planning/    // → Future: Planning Service
```

This makes future splitting easy:
1. Extract module
2. Add API layer
3. Point gateway to new service
4. Done!

## Famous Companies That Started with Monoliths

- **Amazon** - Monolith for years
- **Netflix** - Monolith initially
- **Shopify** - Monolith until $1B+ revenue
- **GitHub** - Still largely a monolith
- **Stack Overflow** - Monolith serving millions

They split when they **needed** to, not prematurely.

## Red Flags That You Need Microservices

Watch for these signals:

### Performance Issues
- 🔴 API response times > 1s despite optimization
- 🔴 Database queries slow despite indexes
- 🔴 Can't scale vertically anymore

### Team Issues
- 🔴 Developers blocking each other
- 🔴 Deploy times > 30 minutes
- 🔴 Test suite takes hours

### Business Needs
- 🔴 Different features need different SLAs
- 🔴 Compliance requires data isolation
- 🔴 Different features scale differently

Until you see these: **stay monolith!**

## Questions?

**Q: But microservices are best practice!**  
A: For large scale, yes. For your stage, no. Best practice is **appropriate** architecture.

**Q: What if I need to scale later?**  
A: Modular monolith makes it easy. Plus, scaling is a good problem to have!

**Q: Won't refactoring be expensive?**  
A: Less expensive than maintaining microservices you don't need for 2 years.

**Q: But I want to learn microservices!**  
A: Great! Build the monolith first, then split it. You'll learn both patterns.

## Start Simple. Scale Smart. 🚀

Your users don't care about your architecture. They care about features that work. Ship the monolith, get users, then optimize based on **real** needs, not hypothetical ones.
