# Docker Compose Dependency Analysis

## Current Dependency Chain

```
Level 0 (No Dependencies - Start First):
├── postgres-identity (healthcheck)
├── postgres-planning (healthcheck)
├── mongo-thoughts (healthcheck)
├── mongo-journals (healthcheck)
└── redis (healthcheck)

Level 1 (Wait for Databases):
└── identity (waits for postgres-identity + redis to be healthy)

Level 2 (Wait for Identity + Own Database):
├── thoughts (waits for mongo-thoughts + identity to be healthy)
├── journals (waits for mongo-journals + identity to be healthy)
└── planning (waits for postgres-planning + identity to be healthy)

Level 3 (Wait for All Services):
└── gateway (waits for identity, thoughts, journals, planning, redis - NO HEALTH CONDITIONS ⚠️)

Independent (No Dependencies):
└── frontend (no dependencies ⚠️)

Development Tools:
├── pgadmin (no dependencies)
├── mongo-express-thoughts (waits for mongo-thoughts - NO HEALTH CONDITION ⚠️)
└── mongo-express-journals (waits for mongo-journals - NO HEALTH CONDITION ⚠️)
```

## Issues Identified

### ⚠️ **Critical Issues**

1. **Gateway Service**
   - Currently uses `depends_on` without health conditions
   - Should wait for all backend services to be healthy before starting
   - **Risk**: Gateway may try to route to unhealthy services

2. **Frontend Service**
   - Has no dependencies at all
   - May start before backend services are ready
   - **Risk**: Users could access UI before APIs are available

3. **Mongo Express Tools**
   - Only wait for services to start, not for them to be healthy
   - **Risk**: Tools may fail to connect if MongoDB is starting

### ℹ️ **Observations**

**Good Practices Currently in Place:**
- ✅ All databases have health checks
- ✅ All backend services have health checks
- ✅ Backend services properly wait for dependencies to be healthy
- ✅ Identity service is correctly positioned as foundation
- ✅ Proper separation of databases per service

**Startup Order Logic:**
```
1. Databases & Redis start in parallel (Level 0)
2. Wait for all databases to be healthy
3. Identity service starts (depends on postgres-identity + redis)
4. Wait for Identity to be healthy
5. Application services start in parallel (thoughts, journals, planning)
6. Wait for all application services to be healthy
7. Gateway starts (should route traffic)
8. Frontend starts (serves UI)
```

## Recommended Dependency Structure

```yaml
# Level 0: Infrastructure (No dependencies)
postgres-identity:    # ✅ Has healthcheck
postgres-planning:    # ✅ Has healthcheck
mongo-thoughts:       # ✅ Has healthcheck
mongo-journals:       # ✅ Has healthcheck
redis:                # ✅ Has healthcheck

# Level 1: Foundation Service
identity:
  depends_on:
    postgres-identity: { condition: service_healthy }  # ✅ Correct
    redis: { condition: service_healthy }              # ✅ Correct

# Level 2: Application Services
thoughts:
  depends_on:
    mongo-thoughts: { condition: service_healthy }     # ✅ Correct
    identity: { condition: service_healthy }           # ✅ Correct

journals:
  depends_on:
    mongo-journals: { condition: service_healthy }     # ✅ Correct
    identity: { condition: service_healthy }           # ✅ Correct

planning:
  depends_on:
    postgres-planning: { condition: service_healthy }  # ✅ Correct
    identity: { condition: service_healthy }           # ✅ Correct

# Level 3: API Gateway (NEEDS FIX)
gateway:
  depends_on:
    identity: { condition: service_healthy }           # ⚠️ Should add
    thoughts: { condition: service_healthy }           # ⚠️ Should add
    journals: { condition: service_healthy }           # ⚠️ Should add
    planning: { condition: service_healthy }           # ⚠️ Should add
    redis: { condition: service_healthy }              # ⚠️ Should add

# Level 4: Frontend (NEEDS FIX)
frontend:
  depends_on:
    gateway: { condition: service_started }            # ⚠️ Should add
    # Or directly depend on backend services if no gateway
```

## Health Check Configuration

All services have appropriate health checks configured:

| Service | Healthcheck Command | Interval | Timeout | Retries | Start Period |
|---------|-------------------|----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| identity | wget /health/readiness | 10s | 5s | 3 | 30s |
| thoughts | wget /health/readiness | 10s | 5s | 3 | 30s |
| journals | wget /health/readiness | 10s | 5s | 3 | 30s |
| planning | wget /health/readiness | 10s | 5s | 3 | 30s |
| postgres-* | pg_isready | 10s | 5s | 5 | - |
| mongo-* | mongosh ping | 10s | 5s | 5 | - |
| redis | redis-cli ping | 10s | 5s | 5 | - |

## Benefits of Proper Dependencies

1. **Orderly Startup**: Services start in logical order
2. **No Failed Connections**: Services don't start until dependencies are ready
3. **Faster Recovery**: Failed services restart only when dependencies are healthy
4. **Better Debugging**: Clear dependency chain makes issues easier to trace
5. **Production Ready**: Behaves predictably in orchestration environments

## Testing the Dependency Chain

```bash
# Watch the startup order
docker-compose up -d && docker-compose ps -a

# Verify health status
docker-compose ps

# Test dependency by stopping a database
docker-compose stop postgres-identity
# Identity service should stop/fail health checks
# Thoughts, journals, planning should eventually fail

# Restart database
docker-compose start postgres-identity
# Services should automatically recover
```
