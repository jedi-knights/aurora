# Kubernetes Health Probes Implementation

## 📋 Summary

All Aurora microservices now include comprehensive Kubernetes health probe endpoints and configurations. This ensures reliable service orchestration, zero-downtime deployments, and proper health monitoring in both Docker Compose and Kubernetes environments.

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Health Check Controllers

Created dedicated `HealthController` for each service with four endpoints:

#### **Endpoints:**
- `GET /health` - Legacy health check (backwards compatibility)
- `GET /health/liveness` - Liveness probe for Kubernetes
- `GET /health/readiness` - Readiness probe for Kubernetes  
- `GET /health/startup` - Startup probe for Kubernetes

#### **Services Updated:**
- ✅ **Identity Service** (`services/identity/src/infrastructure/http/controllers/HealthController.js`)
- ✅ **Thoughts Service** (`services/thoughts/src/infrastructure/http/controllers/HealthController.js`)
- ✅ **Journals Service** (`services/journals/src/infrastructure/http/controllers/HealthController.js`)
- ✅ **Planning Service** (`services/planning/src/infrastructure/http/controllers/HealthController.js`)

### 2. Database Connectivity Checks

Each health controller includes database connectivity validation:

**PostgreSQL Services** (Identity, Planning):
```javascript
const result = await this.dbPool.query('SELECT 1 as healthy')
```

**MongoDB Services** (Thoughts, Journals):
```javascript
const dbState = mongoose.connection.readyState
await mongoose.connection.db.admin().ping()
```

### 3. Kubernetes Manifests

Created complete Kubernetes deployment manifests in `k8s/` directory:

```
k8s/
├── identity/
│   ├── deployment.yaml   # Deployment + Service with probes
│   └── secrets.yaml      # Secret configuration
├── thoughts/
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   └── secrets.yaml
├── journals/
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   └── secrets.yaml
├── planning/
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   └── secrets.yaml
└── README.md            # Comprehensive documentation
```

### 4. Docker Compose Health Checks

Updated `docker-compose.yml` with health checks for all services:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "wget", "--no-verbose", "--tries=1", "--spider", "http://localhost:PORT/health/readiness"]
  interval: 10s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 30s
```

All service dependencies now wait for healthy status:
```yaml
depends_on:
  identity:
    condition: service_healthy  # Changed from service_started
```

## 🔍 Probe Details

### Liveness Probe
**Purpose:** Checks if the service process is running  
**Action:** Kubernetes restarts pod if it fails  
**Configuration:**
- Initial Delay: 30 seconds
- Period: 10 seconds
- Timeout: 5 seconds
- Failure Threshold: 3 attempts

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "status": "alive",
  "service": "identity",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-09T12:00:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 3600
}
```

### Readiness Probe
**Purpose:** Checks if service can handle traffic (includes DB check)  
**Action:** Kubernetes stops routing traffic if it fails  
**Configuration:**
- Initial Delay: 10 seconds
- Period: 5 seconds
- Timeout: 3 seconds
- Failure Threshold: 3 attempts

**Response Example (Healthy):**
```json
{
  "status": "ready",
  "service": "identity",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-09T12:00:00.000Z",
  "checks": {
    "database": "connected"
  }
}
```

**Response Example (Unhealthy):**
```json
{
  "status": "not_ready",
  "service": "identity",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-09T12:00:00.000Z",
  "checks": {
    "database": "disconnected"
  },
  "error": "connection timeout"
}
```

### Startup Probe
**Purpose:** Checks if application has finished starting  
**Action:** Waits before switching to liveness/readiness probes  
**Configuration:**
- Initial Delay: 0 seconds (immediate)
- Period: 5 seconds
- Timeout: 3 seconds
- Failure Threshold: 12 attempts (60s max)

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "status": "started",
  "service": "identity",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-09T12:00:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 10
}
```

## 🎯 Kubernetes Best Practices Implemented

✅ **Separate Probes** - Distinct endpoints for liveness, readiness, startup  
✅ **Database Validation** - Readiness checks include DB connectivity  
✅ **Zero-Downtime Deployments** - Rolling update strategy with maxUnavailable: 0  
✅ **Resource Limits** - Defined requests and limits for all services  
✅ **Graceful Shutdown** - 30-second termination grace period  
✅ **High Availability** - 2 replicas per service by default  
✅ **Secret Management** - Externalized sensitive configuration  
✅ **Proper Labels** - Consistent labeling for service discovery  

## 🚀 Testing the Health Endpoints

### Local Testing (Development)

```bash
# Start services with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d

# Wait for services to be healthy
docker-compose ps

# Test health endpoints
curl http://localhost:5001/health
curl http://localhost:5001/health/liveness
curl http://localhost:5001/health/readiness
curl http://localhost:5001/health/startup

# Test other services
curl http://localhost:4001/health/readiness  # Thoughts
curl http://localhost:4002/health/readiness  # Journals
curl http://localhost:4003/health/readiness  # Planning
```

### Kubernetes Testing

```bash
# Deploy to Kubernetes
kubectl apply -R -f k8s/

# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -w

# Check health from inside cluster
kubectl run test-pod --rm -it --image=alpine/curl -- sh
curl http://identity-service:5000/health/readiness

# Port forward and test locally
kubectl port-forward svc/identity-service 5000:5000
curl http://localhost:5000/health/readiness

# View pod health status
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

# Check logs for health check issues
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

## 📊 Monitoring Integration

The health endpoints can be integrated with various monitoring tools:

### Prometheus
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'aurora-services'
    metrics_path: '/health'
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - 'identity-service:5000'
        - 'thoughts-service:4001'
        - 'journals-service:4002'
        - 'planning-service:4003'
```

### Grafana Dashboards
Monitor health check response times and failure rates.

### Kubernetes Events
```bash
kubectl get events --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Readiness Probe Failing

**Symptom:** Pod not receiving traffic

**Check:**
```bash
# View logs
kubectl logs <pod-name>

# Exec into pod and test manually
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- sh
wget -O- http://localhost:PORT/health/readiness

# Check database connectivity
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- sh
# For PostgreSQL
nc -zv postgres-service 5432
# For MongoDB
nc -zv mongo-service 27017
```

**Common Causes:**
- Database not ready
- Network connectivity issues
- Service not fully initialized
- Database credentials incorrect

### Liveness Probe Failing

**Symptom:** Pod keeps restarting

**Check:**
```bash
# View previous logs
kubectl logs <pod-name> --previous

# Check events
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

**Common Causes:**
- Application crash
- Memory leak (OOM)
- Deadlock/hang
- Incorrect probe configuration

### Startup Probe Timing Out

**Symptom:** Pod never becomes ready

**Solution:** Increase failure threshold or period
```yaml
startupProbe:
  failureThreshold: 20  # Increase from 12
  periodSeconds: 10     # Check less frequently
```

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- **Probe Overhead:** Minimal, simple HTTP GET requests
- **Database Load:** Probes use lightweight queries (`SELECT 1`)
- **Network Traffic:** ~1KB per probe check
- **CPU Impact:** Negligible (<1% per service)

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Health endpoints do not expose sensitive information
- No authentication required (internal endpoints only)
- Database connection details never returned in responses
- Error messages sanitized for production

## 📝 Code Examples

### Testing Health Endpoints in CI/CD

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# wait-for-healthy.sh

SERVICE_URL=$1
MAX_ATTEMPTS=30
ATTEMPT=0

echo "Waiting for $SERVICE_URL to be healthy..."

until curl -sf "$SERVICE_URL/health/readiness" > /dev/null; do
    ATTEMPT=$((ATTEMPT + 1))
    if [ $ATTEMPT -eq $MAX_ATTEMPTS ]; then
        echo "Service failed to become healthy after $MAX_ATTEMPTS attempts"
        exit 1
    fi
    echo "Attempt $ATTEMPT/$MAX_ATTEMPTS - Service not ready yet..."
    sleep 2
done

echo "Service is healthy!"
```

### Integrating with Load Balancers

**NGINX:**
```nginx
upstream identity_backend {
    server identity-service:5000 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s;
    
    # Health check
    check interval=10000 rise=2 fall=3 timeout=5000
          type=http;
    check_http_send "GET /health/readiness HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n";
    check_http_expect_alive http_2xx;
}
```

**HAProxy:**
```haproxy
backend identity_backend
    option httpchk GET /health/readiness
    http-check expect status 200
    server identity1 identity-service:5000 check inter 10s
```
