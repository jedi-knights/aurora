# 🌿 Project Concept: Aurora

> **A unified personal space for thought, journaling, and planning — where each mode feels like its own app, yet everything stays connected.**

---

## 🧭 Vision

Aurora is designed to give users — like students, creators, and thinkers — a single, serene place to organize their **thoughts**, **journals**, and **plans**.  

Instead of switching between apps for notes, calendars, and reflections, Aurora combines them into one cohesive experience while keeping each mode visually and functionally distinct.

## 🧩 Core Modes

| Mode | Purpose | Possible Features |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Journals** | Expressive writing and reflection | Multiple journals (e.g., “Dreams”, “Gratitude”, “Ideas”), markdown or rich-text editor, tags, mood tracking, daily streaks |
| **Notes / Thoughts** | Quick capture and organization | Notebook hierarchy, tagging, AI-assisted summaries (“Organize this thought into my School Journal”), linking between notes |
| **Planner / Calendar** | Structure and time management | Calendar view (month/week/day), integration with Google Calendar or local DB, daily agenda + reminders, recurring goals |
| **Dashboard / Home** | Cohesive overview | Today’s journal prompt, today’s tasks, inspirational quote, quick-add buttons |
| **Search / Insight Layer** | Cross-module intelligence | “Show me all journal entries where I mentioned ‘anxiety’,” “What goals did I set in May?” |

---

## 🎨 Design Language

Each section should *feel like its own app* — a distinctive atmosphere within a shared ecosystem:

- **Journals** → calm, serif fonts, warm tones  
- **Notes** → minimalist, fast, utilitarian  
- **Planner** → clean, grid-based layout with accent color  
- **Navigation** → unified through bottom tabs or swipe gestures for subtle cohesion

---

## 🛠️ Technical Stack (Proposed)

| Layer | Tools |
|-------|-------|
| **Frontend (mobile/web)** | Flutter (cross-platform, expressive UI), or Next.js + React Native hybrid |
| **Backend** | FastAPI (Python) or Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage) |
| **Sync / Storage** | Cloud sync with offline-first local DB (SQLite or IndexedDB) |
| **AI-Assisted Features (future)** | Optional LLM integration for journaling prompts, automatic tagging, mood detection |

## 🌟 Summary

Aurora blends reflection, organization, and planning into one peaceful, powerful digital experience.  
Each section acts like its own app — beautifully tailored for its purpose — but unified through shared data, design, and insight.

This project is both a technical and emotional endeavor: building a tool that nurtures thought, creativity, and structure in everyday life.
